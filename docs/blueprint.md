# **App Name**: Clean Slate Canvas

## Core Features:

- Blank Canvas: Renders a completely blank page with a white background, serving as a starting point for custom game logic. 
- Vite Configuration: Configures Vite for optimal performance with React and Tailwind CSS. 
- Tailwind CSS Integration: Sets up Tailwind CSS for styling the application components.
- Clean React Structure: Maintains a minimal App.jsx structure with no default content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) to provide a gentle, neutral base without being stark white.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA) provides a subtle canvas that doesn't distract.
- Accent color: Pale Silver (#D3D3D3) for minimalistic UI elements such as dividers or subtle highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' a sans-serif font, offering a clean and modern look that is highly readable and works well for both headings and body text in a game environment. 
- Whitespace-focused design to keep the game logic visually uncluttered.
- Keep icons extremely minimal. Ensure their size and color do not distract from the game area.
