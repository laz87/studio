## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: NYT Yellow (#F7DA21) for main interactive elements and focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral backdrop that allows the primary yellow to stand out. Desaturated from the yellow primary (hue maintained, saturation 20%, lightness 96%).
- Accent color: Pale orange (#F7B721) as an analogous color for highlights. Approximately 30 degrees 'left' of the primary on the color wheel; different saturation/brightness gives contrast and focus to highlights.
- Header and Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, as the user did not specify a font. Clean, modern sans-serif.
- Mobile-first responsive design to be functional on different device dimensions.
- Use Bee Icon, Shuffle Icon, and more.
- Smooth transitions on tapping letters and submitting buttons.
